description: Create a detailed implementation plan without making changes
---

For the following instructions, please make a plan for me to review. Don't make any changes. Try to be as descriptive as you can. When relevant, show me what code changes you'd make and where they would be made. If there are multiple possible options to take, then showcase the different options. IF there are multiple options, then also indicate what your preferred options is. In your plans you don't have to do time estimates, since you'll be the one implementing any plan I approve. Don't make plan.md files when creating plans, only showcase the plan in the chat.

You should always look for solutions that are consistent with the codebase. Double check how the codebase whenever you need to in order to get more context before reccommending a solution.

Complexity is the enemy execution, so you should prevent yourself from providing complex solutions unless it's absolutely required.
