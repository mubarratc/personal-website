description: Debug issues and create a detailed plan without making changes

Take the context I've provided here and debug the issue that I'm facing. Assess what the problem might be and then follow these instructions:

Please make a plan for me to review. Don't make any changes. Try to be as descriptive as you can. When relevant, show me what code changes you'd make and where they would be made. If there are multiple possible options to take, then showcase the different options. IF there are multiple options, then also indicate what your preferred options is.
