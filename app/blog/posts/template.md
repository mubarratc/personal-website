# Your Post Title Here

Write your blog post content here using Markdown.

## Subheading

- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- `Code snippets`

```javascript
// Code blocks with syntax highlighting
const example = "Hello World";
```

## Images

You can add images from the public folder:

![Alt text](/path-to-image.jpg)

## Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Tips for writing your post

- Keep your title clear and engaging
- Update the publishedAt date to today's date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Write a concise summary (1-2 sentences)
- Save this file with a descriptive name like `my-first-post.mdx`
- The filename becomes the URL slug (e.g., `my-first-post.mdx` → `/blog/my-first-post`)
