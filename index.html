            <p>
              Currently, I'm the co-founder & CEO of a company called
              <a href="https://www.charitystack.com" target="_blank"
                >CharityStack</a
              >, a pre-seed stage company that has generated more than $500k in
              ARR and has raised $1 Million in venture capital.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before starting my company, I worked at Apple as a Product Manager
              helping develop a Conversation AI product. My time there was spent
              working at the intersection of Siri & the Messages app for
              business applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm on the pursuit to automate labor. I think everyone should be
              allowed to pursue the opportunity pursue their passions without
              any barriers.
