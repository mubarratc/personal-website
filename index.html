            <h3>CEO, CharityStack</h3>
            <h4>Main: Product | Secondary: Design | Tertiary: Engineering</h3>
            <p>
              Currently, I'm the co-founder & CEO of a company called
              <a href="https://www.charitystack.com" target="_blank"
                >CharityStack</a
              >, a pre-seed stage company that has generated more than $22 million in revenue for nonprofits, $600k in
              ARR and has raised $1 Million in venture capital.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before starting my company, I worked at Apple as a Product Manager
              helping develop a Conversational AI product. My time there was spent
              working at the intersection of Siri & the Messages app for
              business applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              The core function of business is to provide more time for individual leisure.
              However, we are an era where the vast majority of human beings are working more hours than any other generation.
              I believe that humans can only thrive if they are given the opportunity to replace time as function of earning money, with building assets.
              And this can only be done by giving everyone the opportunity to build a business for themselves.
              I'm on a mission to build the everything company for B2B.
